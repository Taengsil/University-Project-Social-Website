<h1>Project Description</h1>

<p>A project I have worked on for my web development class in University. It is supposed to be a social media site, using HTML, CSS, PHP, MySql (using XAMPP as Php/SQL server).</p>

The requirements were the following:
  - Login System, not allowed to visit unless logged in;
  - Each user has their individual profile page;
  - Each user has the ability to search other users;
  - Each user can have a picture and a bio;
  - Each user can leave comments on profile pages;

<h1>Installation:</h1>

<p>Installation instructions will be added at a later date, currently this repository is not able to be set up on other machines as the database generation script is missing.</p>

<h1>Known issues:</h1>

<p>editinfo.php does not update on the comments left by the user.<br><br>
Note: I will implement that using AJAX at a later date to avoid having a blank page to serve as refresh, and without adding an extra button or javascript. </p>
