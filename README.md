<h1>Project Description</h1>

A project I have worked on for my web development class in University. It is supposed to be a social media site, using HTML, CSS, PHP, MySql (using XAMPP as Php/SQL server). 

The requirements were the following:
  - Login System, not allowed to visit unless logged in;
  - Each user has their individual profile page;
  - Each user has the ability to search other users;
  - Each user can have a picture and a bio;
  - Each user can leave comments on profile pages;

<h1>Installation:</h1>

I will add installation instructions at a later date.

<h1>Known issues:</h1>

- As of right now, there is no database generation script comitted to the repository.

- editinfo.php does not update on the comments left by the user. 
Note: I will implement that using AJAX at a later date to avoid having a blank page to serve as refresh, and without adding an extra button or javascript.
